# Titanic-Dataset---Kaggle-Competition
An analysis of Titanic Dataset from Kaggle to predict whether the passengers have survived  of test data.
My submission for the Titanic Kaggle competition is based on a Voting Classifier Ensemble method, combining Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and XGBoost models. The goal of this competition is to accurately predict the survival outcome (survived or not) of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more.
In my approach, I utilized the power of ensemble learning to improve the predictive performance by combining the strengths of multiple models. The Voting Classifier Ensemble method aggregates the predictions from multiple models to make a final prediction, resulting in a more robust and accurate outcome.
The first model in our ensemble is the Support Vector Classifier (SVC). SVC is a powerful algorithm that utilizes support vectors to create decision boundaries and separate data points into different classes. I optimized the SVC model by tuning hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance.
The second model in our ensemble is XGBoost, which is a gradient boosting algorithm known for its efficiency and ability to handle complex data relationships. XGBoost builds an ensemble of weak prediction models (decision trees) and combines them to make accurate predictions.
By combining the predictions of SVC and XGBoost through the Voting Classifier Ensemble method, I aimed to leverage the individual strengths of each model to create a more robust and accurate prediction. The voting strategy used was "soft" voting, which takes into account the probabilities assigned by each model.
My final submission is based on the predictions made by the Voting Classifier Ensemble model on the test dataset. I used the trained model to predict the survival outcome for each passenger in the test set and submitted the results. The performance of our model was evaluated using commonly used evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
I am confident that our Voting Classifier Ensemble approach combining SVC and XGBoost has produced a highly accurate and reliable model for predicting the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic. My submission represents the culmination of rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and ensemble learning techniques.
I would like to express our gratitude to the Kaggle community for providing this opportunity to explore and contribute to the field of machine learning. We believe our approach showcases the potential of ensemble methods in improving prediction accuracy and generalization.
